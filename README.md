When you launch the clicker, the command line opens. Do not turn it off while the clicker is running. When starting, you can press Enter and continue. You will only have 1 thread running on your clicker. Each thread produces about 10 clicks per second. But the more threads, the more clicks per second in geometric progression. If you set 10 threads (I donâ€™t recommend more) then you will get about 2000 clicks per second. 11 threads already distort the counting, and a value greater than 32 can crash the click counting application itself. With 32 threads, the number of clicks exceeds 7000 per second. The number is not exact, I calculated it based on some observational factors, more than 11 simply distorts the count, and more than 32 ruins the counter. The maximum value is 64. I limited the number of threads so as not to break your computer. After 32, my computer with a core i7 11800h 16gb RAM and nVidia rtx 3060 is already starting to lag, and the FPS on the screen is no more than 5-10. I hope my clicker will help you in any way)
